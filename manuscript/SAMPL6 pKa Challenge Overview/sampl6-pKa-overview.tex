\todo[inline]{Explain why we are doing a pKa challenge and connect to past and previous challenges}
SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands). About SAMPL challenges: Collectively, these challenges have assessed the effects of force field accuracy, solvation models, pKa and tautomer predictions.  

During the SAMPL5 challenge, log D predictions experienced difficulties predicting log D values accurately, unless protonation states and tautomers were taken into account.

For this iteration of the SAMPL challenge, we have taken one step back and isolated just the problem of predicting solvent protonation states.

This is the first time a blind pKa prediction challenge has been fielded as part of SAMPL. 
In this first iteration of the challenge, we aimed to assess the performance of current pKa prediction methods and isolate potential causes of inaccurate pKa estimates, with the aim of determining how pKa prediction inaccuracies might impact predicted affinities for drug-like molecules. 
For example, for both logD and binding affinity predictions, any error in predicting the free energy of accessing a minor protonation state in solution that becomes dominant in the complex will directly add to the error in the predicted transfer or binding free energy. 

Challenge goal: determining how pKa prediction inaccuracies might impact predicted affinities for drug-like molecules. For example, for both logD and binding affinity predictions, any error in predicting the free energy of accessing a minor protonation state in solution that becomes dominant in the complex will directly add to the error in the predicted transfer or binding free energy. 

Reason for blind pKa challenge:
- Impact on binding affinity predictions
- Impact on logD predictions (SAMPL6)
- Drug-like molecules are especially challenging.

Protonation state effects were a dominant accuracy-limiting factor for logD from SAMPL5, and should also be accuracy-limiting in binding free energy predictions.
Errors is \pKa{} predictions can cause modeling the wrong charge, protonation and tautomerization states which affect hydrogen bonding opportunities and overall dipole moment of the ligand.

\subsection{Motivation for a blind pKa challenge}

why we are doing a pKa challenge and connect to past and previous challenge?

SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands). About SAMPL challenges: Collectively, these challenges have assessed the effects of force field accuracy, solvation models, pKa and tautomer predictions.  

During the SAMPL5 challenge, log D predictions experienced difficulties predicting log D values accurately, unless protonation states and tautomers were taken into account.

For this iteration of the SAMPL challenge, we have taken one step back and isolated just the problem of predicting solvent protonation states.

This is the first time a blind pKa prediction challenge has been fielded as part of SAMPL.

Potantial benefits of these challenges:  
1. Improving computational methods  
2. Detecting hidden contributors to error

\subsection{Structure and logistics of the SAMPL6 pKa prediction challenge}
\todo[inline]{Describe the structure of SAMPL6 pKa challenge}

Experimental macroscopic pKa values were measured using a UV-metric assay performed using a Sirius T3 [cite exp. paper ]  supported by Merck, MRL,  Rahway NJ.

Communicate concepts behind challenge design and why we made specific choices:  
1. Explain why we have types I, II, III  
2. Explain why we pre-enumerated microstates  


Participants had the option to submit predictions in one of 3 categories: Microscopic pKa values (type I), microscopic state populations (type II), or macroscopic pKa values (type III).

The comparison between macroscopic and microscopic pKa values is not always a straightforward one. 

- When instructions and input files were made available

- Challenge dates

- Input files

- What to predict? Three type of submissions.

- Multiple submissions allowed

- Predicting the pKa values of the whole set wasn't a requirement. 

- 2nd D3R/SAMPL Workshop took place in La Jolla, San Diego on Feb 22-23, 2018.

Referece Figure \ref{fig:dist_exp_pKas}. Drug-like molecules are often larger and more complex than the ones used in this study.

2. Participant supplied structures  

Microstate pairs: Only +/-1 charge change transitions are allowed.
List of allowed transitions. +2 transitions are not considered.

\subsection{Evaluation approaches}

\subsubsection{Statistical metrics for submission performance}

- Root mean squared error (RMSE)

- Mean absolute error (MAE)

- Mean Error (ME)

- Square of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R\textsuperscript{2})

- Slope of prediction vs. experimental value linear fit

Uncertainty in each performance statistic was calculated by bootstapping (10,000) to estimate 95\% confidence intervals.

\subsubsection{Matching algorithms for pairing predicted and experimental pKas}

Explain why it is necessary due to lacking structural information. Cite recommendations from article such as preserving sequence.
Experimental data doesn't inform protonation site and overall charge of species.
 Experimental data doesn't capture the whole picture. We don't know charge and we don't know tautomers.
 We don't know the charge state of macrostates, this causes a matching problem


Explain Hungarian method for matching experimental and predicted pKas

Explain Closest method for matching experimental and predicted pKas

Explain microstate based matching.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\todo[inline]{A paragraph to explain the submission methods. Define method categories: DL, LFER, QSPR/ML, QM, QM+LEC, and QM+MM, Blind predictions, Reference calculations, Null model (pKa prospector lookup)
}
 Submissions spanning different method categories were made to the SAMPL6 \pKa{} Challenge: database lookup (DL), linear free energy relationship (LFER), quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR), machine learning (ML), quantum mechanics (QM) models with and without linear empirical correction (LEC), and combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM+MM). Unique submission IDs were assigned to each submission. Table~\ref{submission-ID-table} matches method names with submission IDs. Unique IDs were also assigned when multiple submissions exists for different submission types of the same method such as microscopic \pKa{}(type I) and macroscopic \pKa{} (type III).

\subsubsection{Which chemicals are harder to predict?}

For physical prediction methods sulfur containing heterocycles, amide next to aromatic heterocycles, compounds with iodo and bromo domains have lower pKa prediction accuracy.

Does molecular descriptors explain errors/performance ?
We looked for correlation with descriptors, and potential explanation for errors. Keep spurious correlations in mind if we have many descriptors. No correlation observed. Reference the SI Figure of correlations.

Reference the SI Figure.

Compare ME of molecules across methods.
Are there molecules often overestimated or underestimated?

No correlation of macroscopic pKa number to the errors? But we have low representation of multiprotic compounds




\subsubsection{Comparing microscopic pKa predictions directly to macroscopic experimental pKa values leads to underestimation of errors}
Discussion of matching experimental and predicted values
\todo[inline]{Difficulty of assessing predicted pKas using experimental data: matching problem}
\todo[inline]{Explain rationale behind how we analyze the data and determine success/failure}

Compare experimental data to microscopic pKa predictions, assuming experimental pKas are titrations of distinguishable sides and therefore equal to microscopic pKas.
Molecules with only 1 pKa or well separated multiple pKas (more than 3 pKa units apart) SM14 and SM18 were excluded from this analysis, since their experimental pKa values don't satisfy these criteria.

Errors computed by microstate-based matching are larger compared to numerical matching algorithms.
Microscopic pKa analysis with numerical matching algorithms may mask errors due to higher number of guesses made.

Conclusions will only be about 4-aminoquinazoline series and benzimidazole (8 molecules, 10 pKas)
Refer to SI figure of dominant microstates.

Choosing molecules with right protonation state is important.
Do people predict the correct sequence of dominant microstates?
 " Even if your pKa prediction is correct, protonation state prediction can be wrong."
 Analyze which state has lowest free energy for each charge group ( The sequence of "experimentally visible states")

\subsection{Analyzing microscopic pKa prediction from the perspective of thermodynamics}
Explain  linearity  relative free energy of protonation states with respect to pH. Free energy perspective simplifies data capturing and analysis. Reference Marilyn's paper.

Thermodynamic cycle closure checking allows evaluation of microsopic pKas  without experimental data.
Checking for thermodynamic consistency


\subsubsection{Cycle closure error}

Marilyn observed very good cycle closure results and very bad one that are up to 10 kcal/mol
 
She suggesting checking the cycle with maximum cycle closure error for each method and reporting that for each method.
An historgam of max cycle closure error will help us bin these results into 3 categoris:
1. good agreement
2. moderate
3. severe 
 
"We think thermodyamic cycles of protonation states need to be closed"
Message: Methods need to checked for cycle closure errors.
There can be information there that can be used to correct pKa predictions.
When cycles are not closed it may be used as an indicator of prediction uncertainty.
