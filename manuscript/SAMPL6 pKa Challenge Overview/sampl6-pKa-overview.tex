\begin{abstract}

Acid dissociation constant (\pKa{}) prediction is a prerequisite for predicting many other properties of small molecules such as protein-ligand binding affinity, distribution coefficient (\logD{}), membrane permeability, and solubility due to the necessity of predicting relevant protonation states and the free energy penalty of each state. 
SAMPL6 \pKa{} Challenge was the first time that a separate challenge was conducted for evaluating \pKa{} predictions as a part of SAMPL. 
It was motivated by the inaccuracies observed in prior physical property prediction challenges, such as SAMPL5 \logD{} Challenge, caused by protonation state and \pKa{} prediction issues. 
The goal of the \pKa{} challenge was to elucidate the performance of contemporary \pKa{} prediction methods for drug-like molecules. 
The challenge set was composed of 24 kinase inhibitor fragment-like small molecules and some of them were multiprotic. 
11 research groups contributed blind prediction sets of 37 \pKa{} prediction methods. 
Four widely used \pKa{} prediction methods that were missing from blind predictions were added as reference methods to challenge analysis. Collecting both microscopic and macroscopic \pKa{} predictions allowed in-depth evaluation of \pKa{} prediction performance. 
This article highlights deficiencies of typical \pKa{} prediction evaluation approaches when the difference between microscopic and macroscopic \pKa{}s is ignored and suggests more stringent evaluation criteria for microscopic and macroscopic \pKa{} predictions guided by the available experimental data. 
Top-performing submissions for macroscopic \pKa{} predictions achieved RMSE of 0.7-1.0 units and included both quantum-mechanical and empirical approaches. 
These predictions included less than 8 extra/missing macroscopic \pKa{}s for the set of 24 molecules. 
A large number of submissions had RMSE spanning 1-3 \pKa{} units. Molecules with sulfur-containing heterocycles, iodo, and bromo groups suffered from less accurate \pKa{} predictions on average considering all methods evaluated. 
For a subset of molecules, the available NMR-based dominant microstate sequence data was utilized to elucidate dominant tautomer prediction errors of microscopic \pKa{} predictions which was prominent for charged tautomers. 
SAMPL6 \pKa{} Challenge demonstrated the need for improving \pKa{} prediction methods for drug-like molecules, especially for challenging moeities and multiprotic molecules. 
The level of \pKa{} prediction inaccuracy observed in this challenge has potential to be detrimental to the performance of protein-ligand binding affinity predictions in two ways: (1) errors in predicted dominant charge and tautomeric state and (2) errors in the calculation of free energy correction for minor and multiple protonation states of the ligand.

\section{Introduction}

The acid dissociation constant (\pKa{}) describes the protonation state equilibrium of a molecule given pH. 
Predicting \pKa{} is a prerequisite for predicting many other properties of small molecules such as protein-ligand binding affinity, distribution coefficient (\logD{}), membrane permeability, and solubility. 
Computer-aided drug design efforts include assessing properties of virtual molecules to guide synthesis and prioritization decisions. 
In such cases an experimental \pKa{} measurement is not possible. Therefore, accurate computational \pKa{} prediction methods are required.

For a monoprotic weak acid (HA) or base (B) dissociation equilibria shown in Equation 1, the acid dissociation constant is expressed as in Equations 2 or its common negative logarithmic form as in Equation 3. 
The ratio of ionization states can be calculate with HHenderson-Hasselbalch equations shown in Equation 4. 

\begin{equation}
HA \rightleftharpoons A^- + H^+ \;\;\;\;\; BH^+ \rightleftharpoons B + H^+
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
K_a = \frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}\;\;\;\;\;K_a = \frac{[B][H^+]}{[B^+]} 
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
pK_a = -\log_{10}{K_a}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
pH = pK_a + \log_{10}{\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}\;\;\;\;\;pH = pK_a + \log_{10}{\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}}
\end{equation}


Ionizable sites are found often in drug molecules and influence their pharmaceutical properties including target affinity, ADME/Tox, and formulation properties~\citep{Manallack:2013:ChemSocRev}. 
Drug molecules with titratable groups can exist in many different charge and protonation states based on the pH of the environment. 
We rely on \pKa{} values to determine in which charge and protonation states the molecules exists and relative populations of these states. 
The pH of the human gut ranges between 1-8 and 74\% of approved drugs can change ionization states withing this physiological pH range~\citep{Manallack:2013:ChemMedChema} and because of this \pKa{} values of drug molecules provides essential information about their physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties. 
A wide distribution of acidic and basic \pKa{} values, ranging from 0 to 12, have been observed in approved drugs~\citep{Manallack:2013:ChemMedChema, Manallack:2013:ChemSocRev}.

Small molecule \pKa{} predictions influence computational protein-ligand binding affinities in multiple ways. 
Errors is \pKa{} predictions can cause modeling the wrong charge, protonation, and tautomerization states which affect hydrogen bonding opportunities and charge distribution of the ligand.
The prediction of the dominant protonation state and relative population of minor states in aqueous medium is dictated by the \pKa{} values. 
The relative free energy of different protonation states in the aqueous state is a function of \pKa{} and pH, it contributes to the overall protein-ligand affinity in the form of a free energy penalty of reaching higher energy protonation states~\citep{deOliveira:2019:J.Chem.TheoryComput.}.

Drug-like molecules present difficulties for \pKa{} prediction compared to simple monoprotic molecules. 
Drug-like molecules are frequently multiprotic, have large conjugated systems, heterocycles, tautomerization. In addition that larger molecules with conformational flexibility can have intramolecular hydrogen bonding which shifts \pKa{} values. These shifts could be real or modeling artifacts due to collapsed conformations caused by deficiencies in solvation models. Yet predicting \pKa{}s of drug-like molecules accurately is a prerequisite for computational drug discovery and design.

The definition of \pKa{} diverges into two for multiprotic molecules: macroscopic \pKa{} and microscopic \pKa{}~\citep{Darvey:1995:Biochem.Educ., Bodner:1986:J.Chem.Educ., Murray:1995:Anal.Chem.}. 
Macroscopic \pKa{} describes the equilibrium dissociation constant between different charged states of the molecule. 
Each charge state can be composed of multiple tautomers. Macroscopic \pKa{} is about the deprotonation of the molecule, not a particular titratable group. 
Microscopic \pKa{} describes the acid dissociation equilibrium between individual tautomeric states of different charges. 
We refer to collection of all tautomeric states of different macroscopic states (charge states) as microscopic states. 
Microscopic \pKa{} value defined between two microstates captures the deprotonation of a single titrable group with a fixed background protonation state of other titratable groups. 
In molecules with multiple titratable groups, the protonation state of one group can affect the proton dissociation propensity of another functional group, therefore the same titratable group may have different microscopic \pKa{} values based on the protonation state of the rest of the molecule.
Different experimental methods capture different definitions of \pKa{}s as explained in more detail in this prior publication~\citep{Isik:2018:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des.}. 
Most common \pKa{} measurement techniques such as potentiometric and spectrophotometric methods measure macroscopic \pKa{}s while NMR measurements can determine microscopic \pKa{}s and microstate populations. 
Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the source and definition of \pKa{} values to interpret their meaning correctly. 
Computational methods can predict both microscopic and macroscopic \pKa{}s. While microscopic \pKa{} predictions are more informative for determining relevant microstates/tautomers of a molecule and their relative free energies, computing predicted macroscopic \pKa{}s is useful for direct comparison of methods to more common macroscopic experimental measurements. In this paper, we explore approaches to assess the performance of both macroscopic and microscopic \pKa{} predictions, taking advantage of available experimental data.

\subsection{Motivation for a blind \pKa{} challenge}

SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands) is a series of annual computational prediction challenges for the computational chemistry community. The goal of SAMPL is evaluate to current performance of the models and to bring the attention of quantitative biomolecular modeling field on major issues that limit the accuracy of protein-ligand binding models.

SAMPL Challenges that focus on different physical properties so far have assessed intermolecular binding models of various protein-ligand and host-guest systems, solvation models to predict hydration free energies and distribution coefficients. 
Potantial benefits of these challenges are motivating improvement computational methods and revealing unexpected contributors to error by focusing on interesting test systems. 
SAMPL Challenges have demonstrated the effects of force field accuracy, sampling issues, solvation modeling defects, and tautomer/protonation state predictions on protein-ligand binding predictions.  

During the SAMPL5 \logD{} Challenge, the performance of cyclohexane-water \logD{} predictions were lower than expected and accuracy suffered when protonation states and tautomers were not taken into account~\citep{Pickard:2016:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des., Bannan:2018:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des.}. 
With the motivation of deconvoluting the different sources of error contributing to the large errors observed in the SAMPL5 \logD{} Challenge, we organized separate of \pKa{} and \logP{} challenges in SAMPL6~\citep{Isik:2018:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des., Isik:2020:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des., Isik:2020:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des.a}. For this iteration of the SAMPL challenge, we have taken one step back and isolated just the problem of predicting aqueous protonation states. 

This is the first time a blind \pKa{} prediction challenge has been fielded as part of SAMPL. 
In this first iteration of the challenge, we aimed to assess the performance of current \pKa{} prediction methods for drug-like molecules, investigate potential causes of inaccurate \pKa{} estimates, and determine how much current level of expected accuracy might impact protein binding affinity predictions. 
In binding free energy predictions, any error in predicting the free energy of accessing a minor aqueous protonation state of ligand that contributes to the complex formation will directly add to the error in the predicted binding free energy. 
Similarly for \logD{} predictions, inaccurate prediction aqueous protonation state that contribute partitioning between phases or prediction of relative free energy of these states will be detrimental to the accuracy of transfer free energy predictions.

The SAMPL6 \pKa{} Challenge was conducted as a blind prediction challenge focus on predicting aqueous \pKa{} value of 24 small molecules that resemble fragments of kinase inhibitors. 
The compound selection process was described in depth in the prior publication reporting SAMPL6 \pKa{} Challenge experimental data collection~\citep{Isik:2018:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des.}.
The distribution of molecular weights, experimental \pKa{} values, number of rotatable bonds, and heteroatom to carbon ratio are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:dist_mol_prop}. The challenge molecule set was composed of 17 small molecules with limited flexibility (less than 5 non-terminal rotatable bonds) and 7 molecules with 5-10 non-terminal rotatable bonds. 
The distribution of experimental \pKa{} values ranged between 2-12 and roughly uniform. 
2D representations of all compounds were provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:molecules_with_MAE_of_all_methods}. 
Drug-like molecules are often larger and more complex than the ones used in this study, however, aimed for the

The dataset composition and details of the \pKa{} measurement technique, except the identity of the small molecules, were announced about a month before the challenge start time. 
Experimental macroscopic \pKa{} measurements were collected with spectrophotometric method of Sirius T3, at room temperature in ionic strength-adjusted water with 0.15 M KCl~\citep{Isik:2018:J.Comput.AidedMol.Des.}. 
The instructions for participation and the identity of the challenge molecules were released at the challenge start date (October 25, 2017). 
A table of molecule IDs (in the form of SM\#\#) and	their canonical isomeric SMILES was provided as input.
Blind prediction submissions were accepted until January 22, 2018. 

Following the conclusion of the blind challenge, the experimental data was made public on January 23, 2018. The SAMPL organizers and participants gathered at the Second Joint D3R/SAMPL Workshop, at UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA on February 22-23, 2018 to share results.
The workshop aimed to create an opportunity for participants to have discussions, evaluate the results and lessons of the challenge together. 
The participants reported their results and their own evaluations in the special issue of the Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design~\citep{JCAMD_special_issue_pKa}. 

In this first iteration of \pKa{} prediction challenge we were not sure what was the best way to capture all necessary information related to \pKa{} predictions. Our aim was to directly evaluate macroscopic \pKa{} predictions comparing them to experimental macroscopic \pKa{} values and to use collected microscopic \pKa{} prediction data for more in-depth diagnostics of method performance.
Therefore, we asked participants to submit their predictions in three different submission types: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Type I:} microscopic \pKa{} values and related microstate pairs
\item {\bf Type II:} fractional microstate populations as a function of pH in 0.1 pH increments
\item {\bf Type III:} macroscopic \pKa{} values
\end{itemize}

For each submission type, a machine-readable submission file template was specified. 
For type I submissions, participants were asked to report microstate ID of protonated state, microstate ID of deprotonated state, microscopic \pKa{}, microscopic \pKa{} SEM.  The reason and method of microstate enumeration is discussed further in Section~\ref{section-enumeration-of-microstates} "Enumeration of Microstates".
The SEM captures the statistical uncertainty of the predicted method. 
Microstate IDs were preassigned identifiers for each microstates in the form of SM\#\#\_micro\#\#\#. 
For type II submission, submission format included a table that started with microstate ID and consecutive columns reporting natural logarithm of fractional microstate population values of each predicted microstate for 0.1 pH increments between pH 2 and 12.
For type III submissions participants were asked to report molecule ID, macroscopic \pKa{}, macroscopic \pKa{} SEM.  
It was mandatory to submit predictions for all fields for each prediction, but it was not mandatory to submit predictions for all the molecules or all the submission types. 
Although we have accepted submissions with partial sets of molecules, it would have been a better choice to require predictions for all the  molecules for better comparison of method performance. 
The submission files also included fields for naming the method, listing the software utilized, and a free text method section for the detailed documentation of each method. 

Participants were allowed to submit predictions with multiple methods as long as they create separate submissions files. Anonymous participation to the challenge was allowed, however all participant opted to make their submissions public.
All blind submissions were assigned a 5-digit alphanumeric submission ID, which will be used throughout this paper. These submission IDs were also reported in the evaluation papers of participants and allow cross-referencing. Submission IDs, participant provided method names, and method categories are presented in Table~\ref{submission-ID-table}. 
There were many instances that multiple types of submissions of the same method were provided by participants as challenge instructions requested. 
Although each prediction set was assigned a separate submission ID we have matched the submissions that originated from the same method according to the reports of the participant.
Submission ID for both macroscopic (type III) and microscopic (type I) \pKa{} predictions of each method (when exists) are shown in Table~\ref{submission-ID-table}.

\subsection{Enumeration of microstates} \label{section-enumeration-of-microstates}

A working \pKa{} microstate definition for this challenge was provided for clarity as follows. 
Physically meaningful microscopic \pKa{}s are defined between microstate pairs that can interconvert by single protonation/deprotonation event of only one titrable group. 
So, microstate pairs should have total charge difference of |1| and only one heavy atom that differs in the number of bound hydrogens, regardless of resonance state or geometric isomerism. 
All geometric isomer and resonance structure pairs that have the same number of hydrogens bound to equivalent heavy atoms are related to the same microstate. 
Pairs of resonance structures and geometric isomers (cis/trans, stereo) won't be considered as different microstates, as long as there is no change in the number of hydrogens bound to each heavy atom in these structures.

\subsection{Evaluation approaches}

The experimental data collected composed of spectrophotometric \pKa{} measurements of both monoprotic and multiprotic compounds, therefore comparison . 
The comparison between macroscopic and microscopic pKa values is not always a straightforward one. 

\subsubsection{Statistical metrics for submission performance}

- Root mean squared error (RMSE)

- Mean absolute error (MAE)

- Mean Error (ME)

- Square of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R\textsuperscript{2})

- Slope of prediction vs. experimental value linear fit

Uncertainty in each performance statistic was calculated by bootstapping (10,000) to estimate 95\% confidence intervals.

\subsubsection{Matching algorithms for pairing predicted and experimental pKas}

Explain why it is necessary due to lacking structural information. Cite recommendations from article such as preserving sequence.
Experimental data doesn't inform protonation site and overall charge of species.
 Experimental data doesn't capture the whole picture. We don't know charge and we don't know tautomers.
 We don't know the charge state of macrostates, this causes a matching problem

\subsubsection{Comparing microscopic pKa predictions directly to macroscopic experimental pKa values with numerical matching leads to underestimation of errors}


Demonstrate how numerical matching often masks the error
Match by Hungarian and calculate accuracy of microstate prediction overall.
When matched by pKa value, do people come with the same transition pairs?

Reference Figure~\ref{fig:microstate-pairs-with-Hungarian-match-vs-experiments}  For most methods the microstate pair of Hungarian predicted pKa does not match experimentally determined microstate pair.



Discussion of matching experimental and predicted values
\todo[inline]{Difficulty of assessing predicted pKas using experimental data: matching problem}
\todo[inline]{Explain rationale behind how we analyze the data and determine success/failure}

Compare experimental data to microscopic pKa predictions, assuming experimental pKas are titrations of distinguishable sides and therefore equal to microscopic pKas.
Molecules with only 1 pKa or well separated multiple pKas (more than 3 pKa units apart) SM14 and SM18 were excluded from this analysis, since their experimental pKa values don't satisfy these criteria.

Errors computed by microstate-based matching are larger compared to numerical matching algorithms.
Microscopic pKa analysis with numerical matching algorithms may mask errors due to higher number of guesses made.




Conclusions will only be about 4-aminoquinazoline series and benzimidazole (8 molecules, 10 pKas)
Refer to SI figure of dominant microstates.

Choosing molecules with right protonation state is important.

Marilyn observed very good cycle closure results and very bad one that are up to 10 kcal/mol
 
She suggesting checking the cycle with maximum cycle closure error for each method and reporting that for each method.
An historgam of max cycle closure error will help us bin these results into 3 categoris:
1. good agreement
2. moderate
3. severe 
 
"We think thermodyamic cycles of protonation states need to be closed"

\caption{ {\bf Aqueous \pKa{} of the ligand can influence overall protein-ligand binding affinity.} {\bf A} When only the minor aqueous protonation state contributes to protein-ligand complex formation, overall binding free energy ($\Delta G_{bind}$) needs to be calculated as the sum of binding affinity of the minor state and the protonation penalty of that state. {\bf B} When multiple charge states contribute to complex formation, overall free energy of binding includes a multiple protonation states correction (MPSC) term ($\Delta G_{corr}$). MPSC is a function of pH, aqueous \pKa{} of the ligand, and the difference between the binding free energy of charged and neutral species ($\Delta G_{bind}^{C} - \Delta G_{bind}^{N}$).

\subsection{Lessons learned from SAMPL6 pKa Challenge}

\todo[inline]{Common challenging factors for accurate pKa predictions. Tautomers, Heterocycles etc.}

Overall results:  
Do any methods predict within experimental accuracy (how is the field doing overall)?
Common challenging factors for accurate pKa predictions. Tautomers, Heterocycles etc.

Discussion of matching problem betwene experimental and predicted values.  
Difficulty of assessing predicted pKas using experimental data: matching problem
Explain rationale behind how we analyze the data and determine success/failure.

Conclusion about prediction performance of individual molecules:
SAMPL6 pKa set consisted of only 24 small molecules which limits our ability to do statistical analysis to determine which chemical substructures contribute to greater errors in pKa predictions.  
Which chemical structures make pKa predictions more difficult?  

What can we learn from failures? Which physical effects are driving failures?
Cycle closure errors


%%%
\subsection{Suggestions for future challenges}
In the SAMPL6 \pKa{} Challenge there wasn't a requirement that prediction sets should report predictions for all compounds. 
Some participants reported predictions for only a subset of compounds which may lead these methods to look more accurate than others, due to missing predictions.
It would have been a better choice to require submissions for whole sets for better comparison of method performance. 

\todo[inline]{Discuss what can be done to further improve future challenges}
How can we maximize what we learn?
What should we have people predict?
How should we select compounds / measure pKas?

\todo[inline]{Suggestions about challenge construction}
Future challenge direction  
Challenge path: predict pKas, give people pKas to predict logDs on same molecules, then predict for new set of compounds logDs without provided pKas.  

Enumeration of protonation states before predictions (which states does one need to consider?)

\todo[inline]{Suggestions about challenge analysis}

NMR experimental techniques could be used to validate microstate information in future challenges

Reporting microscopic pKa predictions with charges, microstate free energies is betetr
Experimental dataset with microstate infromation is more helpful.

\caption{{\bf Evaluation statistics calculated for all microscopic \pKa{} prediction submissions based on Hungarian match for 8 molecules with NMR data.} Methods are represented via their SAMPL6 submission IDs which can be cross referenced with Table~\ref{submission-ID-table} for method details. There are eight error metrics reported: the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean (signed) error (ME), coefficient of determination (R\textsuperscript{2}), linear regression slope (m), Kendall’s Rank Correlation Coefficient ($\tau$), unmatched experimental \pKa{}s (number of missing \pKa{} predictions) and unmatched predicted \pKa{}s (number of extra \pKa{} predictions between 2 and 12. This table is ranked by increasing RMSE. A CSV version of this table can be found in \textit{SAMPL6-supplementary-documents.tar.gz}. }
