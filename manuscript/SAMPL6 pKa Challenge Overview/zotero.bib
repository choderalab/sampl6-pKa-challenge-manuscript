  abstract = {A variety of fields would benefit from accurate pKa predictions, especially drug design due to the effect a change in ionization state can have on a molecule's physiochemical properties. Participants in the recent SAMPL6 blind challenge were asked to submit predictions for microscopic and macroscopic pKa{$\mkern1mu$}s of 24 drug like small molecules. We recently built a general model for predicting pKa{$\mkern1mu$}s using a Gaussian process regression trained using physical and chemical features of each ionizable group. Our pipeline takes a molecular graph and uses the OpenEye Toolkits to calculate features describing the removal of a proton. These features are fed into a Scikit-learn Gaussian process to predict microscopic pKa{$\mkern1mu$}s which are then used to analytically determine macroscopic pKa{$\mkern1mu$}s. Our Gaussian process is trained on a set of 2700 macroscopic pKa{$\mkern1mu$}s from monoprotic and select diprotic molecules. Here, we share our results for microscopic and macroscopic predictions in the SAMPL6 challenge. Overall, we ranked in the middle of the pack compared to other participants, but our fairly good agreement with experiment is still promising considering the challenge molecules are chemically diverse and often polyprotic while our training set is predominately monoprotic. Of particular importance to us when building this model was to include an uncertainty estimate based on the chemistry of the molecule that would reflect the likely accuracy of our prediction. Our model reports large uncertainties for the molecules that appear to have chemistry outside our domain of applicability, along with good agreement in quantile\textendash quantile plots, indicating it can predict its own accuracy. The challenge highlighted a variety of means to improve our model, including adding more polyprotic molecules to our training set and more carefully considering what functional groups we do or do not identify as ionizable.},

  abstract = {We consider the conformational flexibility of molecules and its implications for micro- and macro-pKa. The corresponding formulas are derived and discussed against the background of a comprehensive scientific and algorithmic description of the latest version of our computer program Jaguar pKa, a density functional theory-based pKa predictor, which is now capable of acting on multiple conformations explicitly. Jaguar pKa is essentially a complex computational workflow incorporating research and technologies from the fields of cheminformatics, molecular mechanics, quantum mechanics, and implicit solvation models. The workflow also makes use of automatically applied empirical corrections which account for the systematic errors resulting from the neglect of explicit solvent interactions in the algorithm's implicit solvent model. Applications of our program to large, flexible organic molecules representing several classes of functional groups are shown, with a particular emphasis in illustrations laid on drug-like molecules. It is demonstrated that a combination of aggressive conformational search and an explicit consideration of multiple conformations nearly eliminates the dependence of results on the initially chosen conformation. In certain cases this leads to unprecedented accuracy, which is sufficient for distinguishing stereoisomers that have slightly different pKa values. An application of Jaguar pKa to proton sponges, the pKa of which are strongly influenced by steric effects, showcases the advantages that pKa predictors based on quantum mechanical calculations have over similar empirical programs.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of ligand binding affinities is of key importance in small molecule lead optimization and a central task in computational medicinal chemistry. Over the years, advances in both computer hardware and computational methodologies have established free energy perturbation (FEP) methods as among the most reliable and rigorous approaches to compute protein-ligand binding free energies. However, accurate description of ionization and tautomerism of ligands is still a major challenge in structure-based prediction of binding affinities. Druglike molecules are often weak acid or bases with multiple accessible protonation and tautomeric states that can contribute significantly to the binding process. To address this issue, we introduce in this work the pKa and tautomeric state correction approach. This approach is based on free energy perturbation formalism and provides a rigorous treatment of the ionization and tautomeric equilibria of ligands in solution and in the protein complexes. A series of Kinesin Spindle Protein (KSP) and Factor Xa inhibitor molecules were used as test cases. Our results demonstrate that the pKa and tautomeric state correction approach is able to rigorously and accurately incorporate multiple protonation and tautomeric states in the binding affinity calculations.},

For a variety of 43 organic bases the directly calculated values of the free energies of dissociation in water showed a very good correlation with experimental base pKa values (r2 ϭ 0.98), corresponding to a standard deviation of 0.56 pKa units. Thus, we have an a priori prediction method for base pKa with the regression constant and the slope as only adjusted parameters. In accord with recent findings for pKa acidity predictions, the slope of pKa vs. {$\varhexagonlrbonds$}Gdiss was significantly smaller than the theoretically expected value of 1/RTln(10). The predictivity of the presented method is general and not restricted to certain compound classes, but systematic corrections of 1 and 2 pKa units for secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines are required, respectively. The pKa prediction method was validated on a set of 58 complex multifunctional drug-like compounds, yielding an RMS accuracy of 0.66 pKa units.},

  abstract = {The \-pKa is the standard measure used to describe the aqueous proton affinity of a compound, indicating the proton concentration (pH) at which two protonation states (e.g. A\- - and AH) have equal free energy. However, compounds can have additional protonation states (e.g. A\- H2+), and may assume multiple tautomeric forms, with the protons in different positions (microstates). Macroscopic p\- Kas give the pH where the molecule changes its total number of protons, while microscopic \-pKas identify the tautomeric states involved. As tautomers have the same number of protons, the free energy difference between them and their relative probability is pH independent so there is no p\- Ka connecting them. The question arises: What is the best way to describe protonation equilibria of a complex molecule in any pH range? Knowing the number of protons and the relative free energy of all microstates at a single pH, {$\increment$}G\textdegree, provides all the information needed to determine the free energy, and thus the probability of each microstate at each pH. Microstate probabilities as a function of pH generate titration curves that highlight the low energy, observable microstates, which can then be compared with experiment. A network description connecting microstates as nodes makes it straightforward to test thermodynamic consistency of microstate free energies. The utility of this analysis is illustrated by a description of one molecule from the SAMPL6 Blind p\- Ka Prediction Challenge. Analysis of microstate {$\increment$}G\textdegree s also makes a more compact way to archive and compare the pH dependent behavior of compounds with multiple protonatable sites.},

  abstract = {Determining the net charge and protonation states populated by a small molecule in an environment of interest or the cost of altering those protonation states upon transfer to another environment is a prerequisite for predicting its physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties. The environment of interest can be aqueous, an organic solvent, a protein binding site, or a lipid bilayer. Predicting the protonation state of a small molecule is essential to predicting its interactions with biological macromolecules using computational models. Incorrectly modeling the dominant protonation state, shifts in dominant protonation state, or the population of significant mixtures of protonation states can lead to large modeling errors that degrade the accuracy of physical modeling. Low accuracy hinders the use of physical modeling approaches for molecular design. For small molecules, the acid dissociation constant (pKa) is the primary quantity needed to determine the ionic states populated by a molecule in an aqueous solution at a given pH. As a part of SAMPL6 community challenge, we organized a blind pKa prediction component to assess the accuracy with which contemporary pKa prediction methods can predict this quantity, with the ultimate aim of assessing the expected impact on modeling errors this would induce. While a multitude of approaches for predicting pKa values currently exist, predicting the pKas of drug-like molecules can be difficult due to challenging properties such as multiple titratable sites, heterocycles, and tautomerization. For this challenge, we focused on set of 24 small molecules selected to resemble selective kinase inhibitors\textemdash an important class of therapeutics replete with titratable moieties. Using a Sirius T3 instrument that performs automated acid\textendash base titrations, we used UV absorbancebased pKa measurements to construct a high-quality experimental reference dataset of macroscopic pKas for the evaluation of computational pKa prediction methodologies that was utilized in the SAMPL6 pKa challenge. For several compounds in which the microscopic protonation states associated with macroscopic pKas were ambiguous, we performed follow-up NMR experiments to disambiguate the microstates involved in the transition. This dataset provides a useful standard benchmark dataset for the evaluation of pKa prediction methodologies on kinase inhibitor-like compounds.},

  abstract = {Partition coefficients describe the equilibrium partitioning of a single, defined charge state of a solute between two liquid phases in contact, typically a neutral solute. Octanol\textendash water partition coefficients ({$\mkern1mu$}Kow{$\mkern1mu$}), or their logarithms (log P), are frequently used as a measure of lipophilicity in drug discovery. The partition coefficient is a physicochemical property that captures the thermodynamics of relative solvation between aqueous and nonpolar phases, and therefore provides an excellent test for physics-based computational models that predict properties of pharmaceutical relevance such as protein-ligand binding affinities or hydration/solvation free energies. The SAMPL6 Part II octanol\textendash water partition coefficient prediction challenge used a subset of kinase inhibitor fragment-like compounds from the SAMPL6 pKa prediction challenge in a blind experimental benchmark. Following experimental data collection, the partition coefficient dataset was kept blinded until all predictions were collected from participating computational chemistry groups. A total of 91 submissions were received from 27 participating research groups. This paper presents the octanol\textendash water log P dataset for this SAMPL6 Part II partition coefficient challenge, which consisted of 11 compounds (six 4-aminoquinazolines, two benzimidazole, one pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine, one pyridine, one 2-oxoquinoline substructure containing compounds) with log P values in the range of 1.95\textendash 4.09. We describe the potentiometric log P measurement protocol used to collect this dataset using a Sirius T3, discuss the limitations of this experimental approach, and share suggestions for future log P data collection efforts for the evaluation of computational methods.},

  abstract = {The SAMPL Challenges aim to focus the biomolecular and physical modeling community on issues that limit the accuracy of predictive modeling of protein-ligand binding for rational drug design. In the SAMPL5 log D Challenge, designed to benchmark the accuracy of methods for predicting drug-like small molecule transfer free energies from aqueous to nonpolar phases, participants found it difficult to make accurate predictions due to the complexity of protonation state issues. In the SAMPL6 log P Challenge, we asked participants to make blind predictions of the octanol\textendash water partition coefficients of neutral species of 11 compounds and assessed how well these methods performed absent the complication of protonation state effects. This challenge builds on the SAMPL6 p{$\mkern1mu$}Ka Challenge, which asked participants to predict p{$\mkern1mu$}Ka values of a superset of the compounds considered in this log P challenge. Blind prediction sets of 91 prediction methods were collected from 27 research groups, spanning a variety of quantum mechanics (QM) or molecular mechanics (MM)-based physical methods, knowledge-based empirical methods, and mixed approaches. There was a 50\% increase in the number of participating groups and a 20\% increase in the number of submissions compared to the SAMPL5 log D Challenge. Overall, the accuracy of octanol\textendash water log P predictions in SAMPL6 Challenge was higher than cyclohexane\textendash water log D predictions in SAMPL5, likely because modeling only the neutral species was necessary for log P and several categories of method benefited from the vast amounts of experimental octanol\textendash water log P data. There were many highly accurate methods: 10 diverse methods achieved RMSE less than 0.5 log P units. These included QM-based methods, empirical methods, and mixed methods with physical modeling supported with empirical corrections. A comparison of physical modeling methods showed that QM-based methods outperformed MM-based methods. The average RMSE of the most accurate five MM-based, QM-based, empirical, and mixed approach methods based on RMSE were 0.92 {$\pm$} 0.13, 0.48 {$\pm$} 0.06, 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.05, and 0.50 {$\pm$} 0.06, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} The logarithmic acid dissociation constant pKa reflects the ionization of a chemical, which affects lipophilicity, solubility, protein binding, and ability to pass through the plasma membrane. Thus, pKa affects chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties. Multiple proprietary software packages exist for the prediction of pKa, but to the best of our knowledge no free and open-source programs exist for this purpose. Using a freely available data set and three machine learning approaches, we developed open-source models for pKa prediction.
Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The experimental strongest acidic and strongest basic pKa values in water for 7912 chemicals were obtained from DataWarrior, a freely available software package. Chemical structures were curated and standardized for quantitative structure\textendash activity relationship (QSAR) modeling using KNIME, and a subset comprising 79\% of the initial set was used for modeling. To evaluate different approaches to modeling, several datasets were constructed based on different processing of chemical structures with acidic and/or basic pKas. Continuous molecular descriptors, binary fingerprints, and fragment counts were generated using PaDEL, and pKa prediction models were created using three machine learning methods, (1) support vector machines (SVM) combined with k-nearest neighbors (kNN), (2) extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and (3) deep neural networks (DNN).
Results:\hspace{0.6em} The three methods delivered comparable performances on the training and test sets with a root-meansquared error (RMSE) around 1.5 and a coefficient of determination \-(R2) around 0.80. Two commercial pKa predictors from ACD/Labs and ChemAxon were used to benchmark the three best models developed in this work, and performance of our models compared favorably to the commercial products.
Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} This work provides multiple QSAR models to predict the strongest acidic and strongest basic pKas of chemicals, built using publicly available data, and provided as free and open-source software on GitHub.},

In the context of the SAMPL6 challenge, macroscopic pKa values were blindly predicted for a set of 24 of such molecules. In this paper we present two similar quantum chemical based approaches based on the high accuracy calculation of standard reaction free energies and the subsequent determination of those pKa values via a linear free energy relationship. Both approaches use extensive conformational sampling and apply hybrid and double-hybrid density functional theory with continuum solvation to calculate free energies. The blindly calculated macroscopic pKa values were in excellent agreement with the experiment.},

The solvation free energy difference of the acid and its conjugate base is calculated at MD level using thermodynamic integration. We applied this method to the 24 drug-like molecules in the SAMPL6 blind pKa prediction challenge. We achieved an overall RMSE of 2.4 pKa units in our prediction. Our results show that further optimization of the protocol needs to be done before this method can be used as an alternative approach to the well established approaches of a full quantum level or empirical pKa prediction methods.},

  abstract = {Macroscopic pKa values were calculated for all compounds in the SAMPL6 blind prediction challenge, based on quantum chemical calculations with a continuum solvation model and a linear correction derived from a small training set. Microscopic pKa values were derived from the gas-phase free energy difference between protonated and deprotonated forms together with the Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Solvation Model and the experimental solvation free energy of the proton. pH-dependent microstate free energies were obtained from the microscopic pKas with a maximum likelihood estimator and appropriately summed to yield macroscopic pKa values or microstate populations as function of pH. We assessed the accuracy of three approaches to calculate the microscopic pKas: direct use of the quantum mechanical free energy differences and correction of the direct values for short-comings in the QM solvation model with two different linear models that we independently derived from a small training set of 38 compounds with known pKa. The predictions that were corrected with the linear models had much better accuracy [root-mean-square error (RMSE) 2.04 and 1.95 pKa units] than the direct calculation (RMSE 3.74). Statistical measures indicate that some systematic errors remain, likely due to differences in the SAMPL6 data set and the small training set with respect to their interactions with water. Overall, the current approach provides a viable physics-based route to estimate macroscopic pKa values for novel compounds with reasonable accuracy.},

  abstract = {The ``embedded cluster reference interaction site model'' (EC-RISM) integral equation theory is applied to the problem of predicting aqueous pKa values for drug-like molecules based on an ensemble of tautomers. EC-RISM is based on selfconsistent calculations of a solute's electronic structure and the distribution function of surrounding water. Following-up on the workflow developed after the SAMPL5 challenge on cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients we extended and improved the methodology by taking into account exact electrostatic solute\textendash solvent interactions taken from the wave function in solution. As before, the model is calibrated against Gibbs energies of hydration from the ``Minnesota Solvation Database'' and a public dataset of acidity constants of organic acids and bases by adjusting in total 4 parameters, among which only 3 are relevant for predicting pKa values. While the best-performing training model yields a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1 pK unit, the corresponding test set prediction on the full SAMPL6 dataset of macroscopic pKa values using the same level of theory exhibits slightly larger error (1.7 pK units) than the best test set model submitted (1.7 pK units for corresponding training set vs. test set performance of 1.6). Post-submission analysis revealed a number of physical optimization options regarding the numerical treatment of electrostatic interactions and conformational sampling. While the experimental test set data revealed after submission was not used for reparametrizing the methodology, the best physically optimized models consequentially result in RMSEs of 1.5 if only improved electrostatic interactions are considered and of 1.1 if, in addition, conformational sampling accounts for quantum-chemically derived rankings. We conclude that these numbers are probably near the ultimate accuracy achievable with the simple 3-parameter model using a single or the two best-ranking conformations per tautomer or microstate. Finally, relations of the present macrostate approach to microstate pKa results are discussed and some illustrative results for microstate populations are presented.},

The SMD solvation model was employed with M06-2X and different basis sets to evaluate three pKa calculation schemes (direct, vertical, and adiabatic). The adiabatic scheme is the most accurate approach (RMSE\,=\,1.40 pKa units) and has high correlation \-(R2\,=\,0.93), with respect to experiment. This approach can be improved by applying a linear correction to yield an RMSE of 0.73 pKa units. Additionally, we consider including explicit solvent representation and multiple lower-energy conformations to improve the predictions for outliers. Adding three water molecules explicitly can reduce the error by 2\textendash 4 pKa units, with respect to experiment, whereas including multiple local minima conformations does not necessarily improve the pKa prediction.},
